    <h2>Why Information Assurance & Security Matters</h2>
    <p>
        In the digital age, information is one of the most valuable organizational assets. Protecting it is no longer just an IT concern ‚Äî it‚Äôs a critical business, legal, and ethical responsibility.
        Information Assurance (IA) ensures that information remains <strong>confidential</strong>, <strong>integrity</strong>, and <strong>available</strong> to authorized users, while Information Security (InfoSec) focuses on safeguarding it from threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whitman & Mattord emphasize that successful security programs require both <strong>due care</strong> and <strong>due diligence</strong>: the proactive planning to protect information and the continuous oversight to ensure protections remain effective.
    </p>
    <p>
        With cyber threats growing in sophistication, a well-structured security approach combines <strong>people, processes, and technology</strong>. This integrated defense safeguards against breaches, ensures business continuity, complies with laws, and maintains trust with stakeholders.

            <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
            <p>Ensures sensitive information is accessible only to authorized users. Protects privacy and prevents unauthorized disclosure through encryption, authentication, and access controls.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <div class="icon">‚úÖ</div>
            <h3>Integrity</h3>
            <p>Guarantees that data remains accurate, complete, and unaltered during storage, processing, or transmission, using hashing, checksums, and change management policies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <div class="icon">‚ö°</div>
            <h3>Availability</h3>
            <p>Ensures information and systems are accessible when needed by authorized users, maintained through redundancy, disaster recovery, and uptime monitoring.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <div class="icon">üë§</div>
            <h3>Authentication</h3>
            <p>Validates the identity of users, devices, or systems using credentials, biometrics, or multi-factor authentication before granting access to resources.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <div class="icon">üìú</div>
            <h3>Accountability</h3>
            <p>Tracks actions of users and systems through logging and auditing, enabling investigation and ensuring responsibility for actions taken.</p>

            <h3>Legal & Ethical Compliance</h3>
            <p>Aligns security practices with laws, regulations, and ethical standards, minimizing legal risk and protecting organizational reputation.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">The Broader Impact</h2>
    <p>
        Information Assurance and Security are not isolated technical tasks ‚Äî they‚Äôre integral to business strategy, risk management, and organizational survival. 
        A breach can result in loss of trust, legal penalties, operational downtime, and financial damage. By embedding security into the culture and processes, organizations ensure resilience against an ever-changing threat landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
        As Whitman & Mattord note, the strongest defenses are proactive, layered, and continuously evolving. Security is a journey, not a destination.
